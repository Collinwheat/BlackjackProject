### BlackJack Project

# Description
This project emulates a game of blackjack within the console, where the User is the player, and the dealer is played by the program. First, the player and dealer are both dealt 2 cards. Then, based on the decision of the user, the player can either hit, or stay. Hitting will add one card to the players hand. If the value of the player's hand is over 21, player busts and the dealer wins. If the value is 21, the player automatically wins that hand. If the player chooses to stand, the dealer begins it's turn. The dealer reveals its current hand to the user. If the value of the hand is less than 17, the dealer is forced to hit, adding another card to the hand. If the value is over 17, the dealer stands. Finally, the value of the player's and dealer's hands are evaluated. The winning hand is the one that is closest to 21 without going over. To play a hand, run the program, and follow the prompts in the console.

# Lessons Learned
Out of all the projects I've done so far during my time in the Skill Distillery full stack bootcamp, this is the one I've learned the most by doing. I learned how important it is to think through the layout of a program before even starting to write code. Object Oriented programming is making sense now way more than it did when I began this project. The process of passing data through different areas of the program always seemed so scary, but now it seems to come much easier than before. Also, with the heavy implementation of Object Oriented Programming, it is clearer than ever how important it is to have proper variable names that actually describe that particular variable. As people much smarter than I have said, "Code is read more often than it is written".
